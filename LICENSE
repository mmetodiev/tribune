These improvements make the template:

1. More secure with environment variables
2. More user-friendly with proper loading states and error handling
3. Better documented for future use
4. More maintainable with clear project structure
5. Ready for production use with proper error boundaries and loading states

To use this template:

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in Firebase credentials
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

The template now provides a solid foundation for any React project requiring Firebase authentication.
