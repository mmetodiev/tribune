## What Each Approach Does

### Gensim (Extractive)
```
Original:
"The new Tesla Model 3 was unveiled today at the company's 
headquarters. CEO Elon Musk announced significant improvements 
to the battery range. The vehicle now travels 400 miles on a 
single charge. Prices start at $35,000."

Gensim Summary:
"The new Tesla Model 3 was unveiled today. The vehicle now 
travels 400 miles on a single charge."
```
**Method:** Picks sentences from original text  
**Problem:** No intelligence, just statistical sentence ranking

---

### Gemini/GPT (Abstractive)
```
Original: [same as above]

AI Summary:
"Tesla unveiled an upgraded Model 3 with 400-mile range starting 
at $35,000, featuring significant battery improvements announced 
by CEO Elon Musk."
```
**Method:** Understands content, rewrites in own words  
**Benefit:** Intelligent, concise, captures key information

---

### Client-Side JS (Extractive)
```
Original: [same as above]

JS Summary:
"The new Tesla Model 3 was unveiled today at the company's 
headquarters. CEO Elon Musk announced significant improvements 
to the battery range."
```
**Method:** Simple algorithm (first N sentences or keyword frequency)  
**Benefit:** Free and instant, good enough for basic needs

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Summarizing 100 articles per day

**Option A: Gensim**
- First request: 15 seconds ⏳
- Cold starts: ~20-30 per day = 300-450 seconds wasted
- Monthly cost: ~$60
- Setup: 3 weeks
- Result: OK summaries

**Option B: Gemini**
- Every request: 1.5 seconds ⚡
- No cold starts
- Monthly cost: $0 (under free limit)
- Setup: 1 day
- Result: Excellent summaries

**Savings with Gemini:**
- 💰 $60/month
- ⏱️ 5-10 minutes/day of waiting
- 🧑‍💻 2-3 weeks of development time

## Code Comparison

### Gensim Implementation
```python
# functions-py/main.py (200+ lines)
from gensim.summarization import summarize
from firebase_functions import https_fn, options
from firebase_admin import initialize_app, firestore
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

@https_fn.on_call(
    memory=options.MemoryOption.GB_2,  # Expensive!
    timeout_sec=60
)
def summarize_article(req):
    # 50+ lines of code...
    text = extract_article_text(url)
    summary = summarize(text, ratio=0.2)
    return summary
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.11 runtime
- 5+ dependencies
- 1-2 GB memory
- Separate deployment
- Complex error handling

---

### Gemini Implementation
```typescript
// functions/src/summarizer.ts (10 lines!)
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";

export async function summarizeWithGemini(text: string) {
  const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ 
    model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp" 
  });
  
  const result = await model.generateContent(
    `Summarize this article in 2-3 sentences:\n\n${text}`
  );
  
  return result.response.text();
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Node.js runtime (already have)
- 1 dependency
- 256 MB memory (default)
- Same deployment
- Automatic error handling

---

## Detailed Cost Breakdown

### Monthly Usage: 3,000 article summaries

**Gensim:**
```
Memory: 2 GB vs 256 MB = 8x multiplier
Compute time: 3 seconds avg
Cold starts: ~500/month × 10 seconds = 5,000 extra seconds

Cloud Functions pricing:
- Invocations: 3,000 × $0.0000004 = $0.0012
- Compute (GB-sec): 
  - Warm: 2,500 × 3s × 2GB = 15,000 GB-sec
  - Cold: 500 × 13s × 2GB = 13,000 GB-sec
  - Total: 28,000 GB-sec × $0.000025 = $70

Monthly total: ~$70
```

**Gemini:**
```
API calls: 3,000 per month
Free tier: 1,500 requests/day = 45,000/month
Your usage: 3,000 < 45,000 = FREE

If you exceed free tier:
3,000 × $0.0001 = $0.30

Cloud Functions (tiny wrapper):
- Compute: 3,000 × 0.5s × 0.25GB = 375 GB-sec × $0.000025 = $0.01

Monthly total: FREE (or $0.31 if heavy usage)
```

**Savings:** $70/month minimum

## My Professional Recommendation

As a senior engineer, I **strongly advise against Gensim** for the following reasons:

1. **10x more expensive** than alternatives
2. **10x slower** for users (cold starts)
3. **10x more complex** to maintain
4. **Lower quality** than modern AI
5. **Higher technical debt**
6. **Worse developer experience**
7. **Worse user experience**

**Instead, use Gemini 2.0 Flash:**
- ✅ FREE for your usage volume
- ✅ Superior quality
- ✅ Faster performance
- ✅ Simpler codebase
- ✅ Better maintained
- ✅ Future-proof

**The only reason to choose Gensim:** If you're legally prohibited from using external APIs (extremely rare).
